This project, "Charming Dashboard," is a command-line interface (CLI) application written in Go. It uses the Bubble Tea library to create a terminal-based dashboard that fetches and displays data from JSON APIs.

Here's a summary of my understanding:

*   **Purpose:** To provide a simple, configurable dashboard that monitors services by displaying data from their JSON APIs.
*   **Technology:** It's built with Go and utilizes several libraries from Charm Bracelet (`bubbles`, `bubbletea`, `lipgloss`) for the terminal UI and `gjson` for parsing JSON.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   It reads a `charming_config.json` file to define the services to monitor.
    *   For each service, it makes an HTTP request to a specified URL.
    *   It parses the JSON response and extracts specific values using `gjson` selectors.
    *   It displays the data in a list format with titles, status indicators, and response times.
    *   The UI supports scrolling, manual refresh, and shows loading spinners.
*   **How to run:**
    *   It can be built using `go build` or the provided `./build.sh` script.
    *   The application is started by running the compiled binary from the `build/` directory (e.g., `build/charming`), optionally passing a path to a custom configuration file.

In essence, it's a terminal-based status board that can be customized to display key information from various web services.
